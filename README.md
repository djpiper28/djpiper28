## Hello World!

I am Danny Piper and I a software engineer with a keen interest in writing software that solves problems well. I am a big fan of good UX, albeit not the biggest
frontend fan in the world. I have spent a lot of my time setting up my homelab which is really over the top, but nice to work with. This homelab is setup such
that the process of getting code into "production" is as easy as possible, I am really pleased with my use of Kubernetes (with Helm) and Jenkins to run all of
my hosted applications. With this setup I have been enjoying using Grafana to make pretty graphs about what is going on with my server.

There are many other things that I am interested in (which are not programming), notably "Magic the Gathering", Minecraft, table top gaming (TTRPGs and wargames),
and speed cubing. I can assure you that I am a very interesting person and the kind of fella you would want to have a pint with in the pub.
